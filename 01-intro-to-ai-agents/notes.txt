What are AI Agents:

Elements:
- LLM: powers ther reasoning behind these agents
- Memory: Short Term (within conversation) or Long Term (allows agent to perform better over time)
- Tools: Different services accessed by apis to perform an action; different functions an agent can run
- Agent uses LLM to identify what task to complete, what tools are needed to complete the task, and memory to gather info and data to complete this task

Code Elements:
Semantic Agent: 
Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open-source orchestration SDK created by Microsoft.
It helps developers build AI-powered applications (agents, copilots, chatbots, etc.) that combine:

LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT-4 or Claude

Traditional code functions

Memory, planning, and tool-calling capabilities

Essentially, it gives your AI “structure” — it’s like a framework for connecting your Python code to intelligent agents.
